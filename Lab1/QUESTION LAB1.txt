Write a C program to 
1. Read from a file: Read the contents of the attached file input.txt and print them on the terminal.
2. Write to a file: Read the contents from input.txt and write them to output.txt file
3. Append to a file: with out effecting the contents of output.txt, append some sentences to output.txt

For doing the above operations, who have to explore the syntaxes of following functions in C.
- fopen function with 3 modes (i.e., read, write, append modes).
- fgets function to read the contents from file one line at a time.
- fputs function to write the contents to file.

This file handling operations will help us in doing the further lab programs.

Save the programs as read.c, write.c and append.c respectively and Submit them in Google class room before next lab.
